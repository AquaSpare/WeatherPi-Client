# WeatherPi-Client

WeatherPi-Client is a lightweight Python client application designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, equipped with various environmental sensors. It periodically collects data such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and sends this information to the WeatherPi-Server. This client is the heart of an IoT-based weather monitoring system, focusing on reliability, ease of use, and flexibility to work with different sensor setups. It's perfect for DIY weather stations and educational projects in data collection and IoT.
